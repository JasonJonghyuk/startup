# Startup

# Jonghyuk's Note
change from vscode haha  
Note: I think it's facinating to see how I can save and load my code from the website. And with git and github, I can work with other people when I'm not with them.  
Note 02/01/2023: It was interesting that I can make a wile card subdomain and I can go to the same website with that subdomain.  
Note 02/06/2023: Something I found interesting was href. I could assigned a hyperlink to my website. But I'm still figuring out what the difference is between putting content inside of main and body.  
Note 02/07/2023: What is the difference between b tag and span tag, since both are inline elements? I think it's interesting to see that I can make certain input place to be required to be able to submit. I'm not sure how to use canvas and SVG yet, but it seems like I can do a lot of things with them. It's interesting to see I can make some amazing visualization.  
Note for HTML website: I'm still trying to understand how the "deployWebsite.sh" works, but it's still super cool to see my website with my own domain. And when I replace profile.png with a photo of myself, it was too big for my website. I'm wondering if it's a default size.  
Note for Simon HTML: I learned how the table attribute works in HTML. And input attribute is also interesting.  But it should have been better if I could save the name of the player and show it when they play the game.  
Note for CSS Practice: I think Animation is the coolest part of doing CSS. I thought I had to use JavaScript if I want to make things moving around. But I can do it even only with CSS.  
Note for CSS Flex: I think it will be super useful if you want to emphasize some sections on your website. Even if the visitors make the browser smaller, they will see what you want them to see if you use flex.  
Note for CSS frameworks: When I first learned about web programming, I thought it would take a long time because I thought I had to make everything from scratch. However, it is very good that the time can be greatly reduced due to the bootstrap And I think it's very convenient because I just have to transform it a little bit as I want.  
Note for JavaScript types, operators, conditionals, and loops: I think it's interesting to use '==='. It does the same thing when you use '==' in python or C++. If I just use '==', even though the type is different, as long as the value is the same, it will give think it's True.
