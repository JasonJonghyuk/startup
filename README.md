Note: I think it's facinating to see how I can save and load my code from the website. And with git and github, I can work with other people when I'm not with them.  
Note 02/01/2023: It was interesting that I can make a wile card subdomain and I can go to the same website with that subdomain.  
Note 02/06/2023: Something I found interesting was href. I could assigned a hyperlink to my website. But I'm still figuring out what the difference is between putting content inside of main and body.
